# Popper

Popper is a convention for generating reproducible papers. This 
repository provides templates to bootstrap research articles that 
adhere to the convention. For general documentation please check the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/ivotron/popper/wiki/Getting-Started).

To make your paper reproducible:

  1. Fork this project
  2. Pick a template (branch) suitable to your needs.
  3. Modify the manuscript and the experiments accordingly.
  4. Submit your article and let the reviewers know that its easily 
     reproducible :smiley:

Every project has 4 components: manuscript, packaging, orchestration, 
and visualization. We currently maintain templates for the following:

  * [Markdown, Docker, Ansible and 
    Jupyter](https://github.com/ivotron/popper/tree/markdown-docker-ansible-jupyter).
